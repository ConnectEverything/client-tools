# The file nightlies-serving/wrangler.toml defines "routes" which will be
# handled by the worker code in that directory.
# Those will be intercepted by CF and served from the KV store, instead
# of the static site which this file manages.
#
# So in addition to whatever we define here, the site will publish:
#  - get-nats.io/current-nightly
#  - get-nats.io/nightly/*
