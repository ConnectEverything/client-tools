    #  * The USA East Coast is either 5 or 4 hours behind UTC.
    #  * Poland uses Central European Time, so is either 1 or 2 hours ahead of UTC.
    #  * So if we pick around 14:30ish UTC, that's at latest 4.30pm Poland, at soonest 9.30am New York.
    # Definitely not a "nightly", more like "daily", but this works for being able to sensibly alert without shenanigans when things go wrong.
